# ACH4Q into 1337 Piscine

I am currently engaged in a comprehensive study of the C programming language, ranging from foundational principles to advanced techniques. This endeavor not only piques my interest but also presents stimulating challenges that foster the development of robust problem-solving skills. I find the pursuit both rewarding and intellectually stimulating. My aim is to solve 1337 days problems
